1) Creating the dataset 

Dataset would focus on Employed Residents Aged 15 Years and Over and I would request the following variables (based on the data available in the 2022 Comprehensive Labour Force Survey (CLFS) )

Independent Variable 
- Whether employed on permanent, fixed-term contract or casual/on-call basis (one hot encoded/ dummy variables)

Dependent Variable 
- Gross monthly income from work (I assume that this is a binned variable) 

I would also request for other variables that may have a significant impact on gross monthly income from work 

Control Variables 
- Sex - To control for the gender wage gap 
- Age - Income may vary based on overall career stage or experience, age can act as a proxy for this 
- Highest qualification attained - Education level often correlates with higher income 
- Years in current job - This a proxy for job specific skills experience that may impact income 
- Whether working full-time or part-time - would need to control for this as full-time vs part-time work would affect renumeration
- Industry - to control for different salary structures in different industries 
- Occupation - 
- Field of study - 
- Employment Status - To focus on Employees (ask for subset), assuning that this is the parameter of the analysis 
- Marital status



- Willingness and availability of part-timers to work additional hours ? 
- Usual hours worked ? 
- Job change ? 

2) Preprocessing data 
- Inspect missing values
- Categorical variables into on-hot encoding 
- Binned variables treated on ordinal or categorical 
- Do some visualisations of income distributions across employment types 
- Analyse correlations between variables 

3) Methodology for Statistical Modelling and Hypothesis Testing 

H0: Employment type has no significant effect on gross monthly income 
H1: Employment type significantly affects gross monthly income 

Use a ordered logistic regression with the control variables
Since the independent variable is categorical and hence transformed into dummy variables, we would use one category (permanent work) as the reference. 
The coefficients for fix-term contract and casual/on-call basis would be interpreted as the change in the gross monthly income from work for someone on a fix-term contract as compared to someone on a permanent work contract. 

Possible to use a random forest regression (for non linear relationships)

Look at the coefficient of the independent variable to see a 
Look a the p-values associated with the coefficients in the model output. If it is below 0.05, indicates that the control variable is statistically significant, meaning that is has a meaningful impact on the outcome of the dependent variable, besides the independent variable.
